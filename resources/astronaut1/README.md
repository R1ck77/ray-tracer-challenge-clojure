This model is a crude 3DS to Wavefront conversion of the model kindly provided by NASA at this url:

The textures have also been compressed aggressively, so make sure to get the original: this one is good only as a prop.

Kudos to NASA for kindly providing so many nice 3D models and, well, for exploring spaceâ€¦
